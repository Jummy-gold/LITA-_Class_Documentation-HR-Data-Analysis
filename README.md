### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the Incubator Hub HR. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used here is Incubator Hub HR Data and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data respository site.

### Tools Used

-- For Data cleaning

-- For Analysis

-- For Data Visualization

- Github for Portfolio Building

- This analysis explore the overall performance of employee in the Incubator Hub HR data, it pay keen attention to the employees educational background, gender and age group as it relates to the rate of attrition.


 ## DATA SOURCE
        
   
Power BI for building visualization base on the data received

Data Cleaning and Preparations

In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following:

i.   Data Loading and Inspection
ii.  Handling Missing Variables
iii. Data Cleaning and Formatting
iv.  Creation of calculated columns in power BI
v.   Creationof Measuresto help with summary

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The data was adequately explored in Power BI, additional columns were created as calculated columns, some other information needed were calculated as measures.


### Data Analysis

Here some lines of codes or queries and some of the DAX expressions that were used during analysis
Attrition Rate = sum(HR Data attrition count)/sum(HR Data employee count) 

Attrition Rate = sum(HR Data attrition count)/sum(HR Data employee count) 

Conditional columns were added to filter down some data so as to get a better visualization, one of those is the creation of conditional column to convert the Job Satisfaction column to Job Satisfaction Rating using figures 1,2,3,4 to represent each satisfactory level.
