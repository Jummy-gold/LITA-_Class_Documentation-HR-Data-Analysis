 ## DATA SOURCE
        
   
Power BI for building visualization base on the data received

Data Cleaning and Preparations

In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following:

i.   Data Loading and Inspection
ii.  Handling Missing Variables
iii. Data Cleaning and Formatting
iv.  Creation of calculated columns in power BI
v.   Creation of Measures to help with summary

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The data was adequately explored in Power BI, additional columns were created as calculated columns, some other information needed were calculated as measures.


### Data Analysis

Here some lines of codes or queries and some of the DAX expressions that were used during analysis

```Attrition Rate = sum(HR Data attrition count)/sum(HR Data employee count) ```

 Conditional columns were added to filter down some data so as to get a better visualization, one of those is the creation of conditional column to convert the Job Satisfaction column to Job Satisfaction Rating using figures 1,2,3,4 to represent each satisfactory level.
